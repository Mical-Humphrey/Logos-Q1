# Logos Live Runbook

This runbook captures the operational steps for paper and live trading modes.
Detailed procedures will be completed alongside Phase 2 deliverables.

## Sprint A: translator + paper broker

- [ ] Translator quantises orders using symbol metadata (price, quantity, lot size)
- [ ] Paper broker records deterministic fills and lifecycle events
- [ ] Account snapshot exposes realized/unrealized PnL and remaining cash
- [ ] Event log summarises submissions, fills, and cancellations

> Placeholder checklist added during scaffolding. Items will be fleshed out when
> implementation work progresses through Sprint A tasks.
