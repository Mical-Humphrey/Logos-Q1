Logos-Q1 — Requirements & Objectives
1. Project Summary

Logos-Q1 is a self-contained educational quantitative trading environment for local desktop use.
It helps learners and independent developers study, build, and test trading strategies with realistic assumptions — no black boxes, no cloud dependencies.

2. Problem Statement
The Problem
    Most quant frameworks are:
    Overly complex, with steep learning curves.
    Hidden behind APIs and opaque math.
    Built for institutions, not individuals.

The Solution
    Logos-Q1 is:
    Readable — pure Python, explicit formulas.
    Educational — teaches math, logic, and trading in one environment.
    Practical — allows realistic backtesting and portfolio simulations.
    Extendable — a foundation for live trading when desired.

3. Target Users
User Type	Needs	Logos-Q1 Advantage
Student / Researcher	Understand market math and trading logic	Clear educational docs and formulas
Independent Quant Developer	Prototype trading ideas quickly	Modular CLI framework
Engineer exploring finance	Learn data handling and signal generation	Lightweight Python architecture
Entrepreneur / Trader	Build personal execution tools	Extensible system with full transparency

4. System Goals
ID	Goal	Description
G1	Educational clarity	Teach every mathematical and financial concept in use.
G2	Realistic backtesting	Include slippage, commissions, spreads, and PnL logic.
G3	Extensibility	Plug in new assets, strategies, and cost models.
G4	Local independence	Full offline operation after data download.
G5	Transparency	No hidden state, reproducible experiments.
G6	Beginner-friendly	Runs with minimal setup on any OS.

5. Functional Requirements
ID	Functionality	Description
F1	Command-line interface	Backtest strategies and output metrics.
F2	Data acquisition	Fetch historical OHLCV (yfinance → cache).
F3	Signal generation	Use strategies to produce trading signals.
F4	Trade simulation	Execute simulated orders and update equity.
F5	Cost modeling	Apply slippage, commission, and spread costs.
F6	Metrics computation	Output Sharpe, CAGR, Drawdown, WinRate.
F7	Visualization	Save equity curve plots and logs.
F8	Logging	Create reproducible audit logs for each run.
F9	Modular strategies	Easily integrate new strategy files.
F10	Education mode	Display contextual learning outputs.

6. Non-Functional Requirements
Category	Description
Performance	Process 10–20 years of data in <5 seconds.
Reliability	Cache data locally; handle missing points gracefully.
Security	API keys stored in .env; read-only during backtest.
Maintainability	Each module documented with docstrings.
Portability	Runs on any desktop OS.
Usability	CLI messages readable by beginners.

7. Problems Solved
Challenge	Logos-Q1 Solution
“Quant frameworks are too complicated.”	Pure Python
“I can’t connect theory to practice.”	MATH.html and FINANCE.md explain every formula.
“I just want to learn and experiment locally.”	No servers; everything runs on your laptop.
“I want to prototype real strategies.”	CLI-based rapid backtesting with real market data.

8. Future Requirements (Roadmap)
Phase	Feature	Description
2.0	Paper trading	Simulated real-time fills via API (Binance/Alpaca).
2.1	Multi-symbol backtesting	Test portfolios and hedged positions.
2.2	GUI interface	Streamlit dashboard for live metrics.
2.3	Parameter optimization	Grid search and sensitivity reports.
2.4	Machine learning	Add predictive models for signal generation.

9. Success Criteria

Logos-Q1 will be considered successful when:
    A new user can clone, run, and interpret it within 1 hour.
    All outputs are reproducible and explainable.
    Each module doubles as a teaching tool.
    Advanced users can easily extend it into a personal trading system.
