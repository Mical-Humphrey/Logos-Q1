# CHANGELOG

## 2025-10-20 â€” Phase 2 Live Execution Readiness

### Highlights
- Documented deterministic live regression matrix (paper + CCXT + Alpaca) with canonical commands and checksums.
- Published comprehensive live runbook covering translator drills, guard simulations, recovery playbook, and baseline governance.
- Updated manual and README with safety checklist, QA command suite, artifact layout, and requirement traceability matrix (FR-001..FR-008, SC-001..SC-004).
- Captured regression artifacts in `docs/PHASE2-ARTIFACTS.md`, enabling sha256 verification for baselines and rehearsals.

### Known Limitations
- `black --check .` currently flags legacy formatting across 60+ modules; formatting remediation is tracked for Phase 3 to avoid churn during live rollout.
- `mypy .` requires installing `pandas-stubs` and `types-PyYAML`, and several live modules (paper broker, persistence) still report strict typing issues; follow-up tickets cover incremental typing.
- Adapter baselines intentionally diverge from the paper snapshot (zero fills by design); refresh requests must document rationale before updating `tests/fixtures/regression/smoke/`.
