# Logos-Q1 — Requirements & Objectives

## 1. Project Summary

**Logos-Q1** is an educational and practical quantitative trading research environment.  
It simulates algorithmic trading on historical data to help users understand markets, build trading intuition, and learn core data science principles applied to finance.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Problem
Aspiring quantitative developers often face:
- Fragmented, overly complex trading libraries.
- Lack of transparency in algorithms (black boxes).
- Poorly documented academic code.
- Difficulty connecting theory (finance & math) with code.

### The Solution
Logos-Q1 solves this by providing:
1. A clean, **single-developer backtesting framework** you can read end-to-end.
2. Minimal dependencies (pandas, numpy, matplotlib).
3. Rich documentation explaining **the math and finance concepts behind each line**.
4. Modular design for incremental learning and expansion.
5. Realistic trading features (commissions, slippage, z-scores, moving averages, portfolio logic).

## 3. Target Users

| User Type | Needs | How Logos-Q1 Helps |
|------------|--------|----------------------|
| **Quant Developer (Beginner–Intermediate)** | Learn architecture, build strategies, test models | Transparent code, modular design |
| **Finance Student / Researcher** | Connect financial theory to implementation | FINANCE.md and MATH.md integration |
| **Engineer exploring markets** | Hands-on coding and data manipulation | yfinance integration and local analysis |
| **Entrepreneur / Indie Quant** | Prototype ideas quickly without costly platforms | CLI automation and open architecture |

---

## 4. System Goals

| ID | Goal | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| G1 | **Educational Clarity** | Explain every major math/finance concept used. |
| G2 | **Strategy Prototyping** | Allow quick iteration on new trading rules. |
| G3 | **Backtesting Accuracy** | Simulate realistic fills with slippage & commissions. |
| G4 | **Performance Measurement** | Provide standard metrics: Sharpe, CAGR, Drawdown, etc. |
| G5 | **Extensibility** | Support additional asset classes and execution models. |
| G6 | **Local Independence** | Run entirely offline after first data fetch. |

## 5. Functional Requirements

| ID | Functionality | Description |
|----|----------------|-------------|
| F1 | Command-line Interface | Run and configure backtests via CLI. |
| F2 | Data Acquisition | Download and cache historical OHLCV data. |
| F3 | Signal Generation | Compute -1/0/+1 trading signals via strategies. |
| F4 | Backtesting Engine | Execute simulated trades, track positions, equity, and PnL. |
| F5 | Cost Modeling | Apply per-share commissions and slippage models. |
| F6 | Metrics Calculation | Compute Sharpe, CAGR, Drawdown, Win Rate, Exposure. |
| F7 | Visualization | Generate equity curve plots and CSV trade logs. |
| F8 | Logging | Log all events and errors for traceability. |
| F9 | Pairs Trading Module | Analyze mean-reverting relationships between assets. |
| F10 | Extensible Strategy Loader | Support easy addition of custom strategies. |

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Reliability** | No external network dependencies during backtest. |
| **Maintainability** | Every function has docstrings and comments. |
| **Performance** | Handle 20 years of daily data under 2 seconds per run. |
| **Usability** | Minimal setup; clear CLI messages and logs. |
| **Scalability** | Supports portfolio-level backtesting extensions. |
| **Portability** | Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows. |

---

## 7. Problems Solved

| Problem | How Logos-Q1 Solves It |
|----------|--------------------------|
| “I don’t understand how quants actually build systems.” | Readable, working architecture you can inspect. |
| “Finance math feels disconnected from coding.” | MATH.md maps every formula directly to source code. |
| “Quant libraries are overkill for beginners.” | No hidden abstractions — pandas-only. |
| “I can’t connect finance concepts like alpha, beta, Sharpe to real code.” | FINANCE.md explains each with examples from your engine and strategies. |
| “I want to simulate trading ideas fast.” | One-line CLI backtesting per strategy. |

---

## 8. Future Requirements (Roadmap)

| Phase | Feature | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| 2.0 | Live paper trading | Connect to Alpaca/Binance API with simulated fills. |
| 2.1 | Portfolio backtesting | Support multiple symbols simultaneously. |
| 2.2 | Parameter sweeps | Add grid search for optimization and reporting. |
| 2.3 | GUI dashboard | Real-time visualization using Streamlit or Dash. |
| 2.4 | Risk analytics | VaR, volatility, and factor attribution. |

---

## 9. Success Criteria

Logos-Q1 succeeds if:
- A beginner can clone, run, and understand it in under 1 hour.
- Each strategy can be backtested end-to-end offline.
- Outputs (equity, metrics) are reproducible and interpretable.
- Documentation serves as a standalone learning guide for finance + math + code integration.
