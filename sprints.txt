Phase 2
========

Implementation Plan
- Order generation: build the strategy-to-order translator that respects symbol metadata, precision, notional caps, and sizing rules.
- Paper broker completion: implement deterministic fills, FIFO inventory, realized/unrealized PnL, order-state lifecycle, and event logging.
- Data feeds: deliver minute-bar feeds (cache replay for tests, yfinance polling for equities, CCXT public polling for crypto) with freshness checks and retry/backoff.
- Risk and circuit breakers: wire max-notional, exposure, drawdown, reject, stale-data, and kill-switch guards into the runner with focused tests.
- State and reporting: persist state.json/state.jsonl for restart support, reconcile open orders, and emit full session artifacts (orders.csv, trades.csv, positions.csv, account.csv, session.md).
- Runner integration: connect the completed components and prove an end-to-end paper session using deterministic fixtures.
- Broker adapters: finalize CCXT and Alpaca connectors for dry runs and credential validation, leaving IB as a documented stub.
- Docs and runbook: refresh README, manual, and live runbook to reflect the finished live workflow.
- Test suite: keep `pytest -q` passing with the new live-mode coverage and without network credentials.

Definition of Done
- `python -m logos.live trade ...` runs end-to-end in paper mode using deterministic feeds, produces the full session artifact set, and exercises all risk guards (kill switch, breaker thresholds, restart flow) with test coverage.
- Strategy order generation reuses backtest signals, emitting quantized `OrderIntent`s that respect market metadata and sizing caps.
- Paper broker, risk module, and data feeds are covered by unit tests; CCXT and Alpaca adapters validate configuration and support dry-run execution paths.
- The config validator blocks unsafe live runs and verifies credential readiness for live adapters.
- Documentation and runbook describe the live workflow, safety checklist, and recovery steps.
- Full test suite passes locally without relying on external networks or real credentials.

Sprint Plan

Sprint A (Core Loop Completion)
- Implement and test strategy-to-order translation.
- Finish paper broker fill logic, inventory tracking, and PnL accounting.
- Build deterministic minute-bar feeds (cache replay and mockable providers), including freshness checks and retries.
- Integrate risk/circuit breakers with targeted tests.
- Finalize state persistence, restart reconciliation, and artifact writers.
- Demonstrate an end-to-end paper session using deterministic inputs, producing the expected artifacts.

Sprint B (Adapters & Polish)
- Complete CCXT and Alpaca dry-run adapters with credential validation and error handling; document IB as a future task.
- Expand reporting (session markdown, summaries) and ensure config validator enforces safety toggles.
- Refresh documentation/runbook to match the finished live pipeline.
- Harden tests and CI workflows around live-mode features, ensuring `pytest` stays green in isolation.



Phase 3 — Visual Dashboard (Streamlit + Plotly)
===============================================

Goal
- Build a read-only Streamlit dashboard that surfaces backtests, live sessions, metrics, and logs from the filesystem. No trading actions in Phase 3 (view-only). The UI must be modular, fast, and safe to run locally.

Scope
- Use Streamlit for the GUI, Plotly for charts, and import canonical paths from logos.paths (add any missing helpers).
- Read artifacts from runs/, data/cache/, and logos/logs/ only; never mutate artifacts from the UI.

Implementation Plan (Read-only UI)
- Package: logos/ui/streamlit/
  - __init__.py
  - app.py (main entry; streamlit run logos/ui/streamlit/app.py)
  - state.py (session_state: selected symbol/run, refresh interval, theme)
  - data_access.py (pure readers using logos.paths; legacy-aware)
  - components/
    - metrics_card.py (CAGR, Sharpe, MaxDD, WinRate, Exposure)
    - equity_chart.py (Plotly equity + drawdown overlay)
    - trades_table.py (paginated trades view with filters/download)
    - log_viewer.py (tail file with autorefresh + regex filter)
  - pages/
    - 00_Overview.py (KPI tiles, recent runs, latest live session)
    - 10_Backtests.py (run explorer; compare runs)
    - 20_Live_Monitor.py (session status, PnL, positions, fills, log tail)
    - 30_Strategy_Lab.py (strategy docs/param schema; no execute)
    - 40_Settings.py (safe .env/config view; theme + refresh)
    - (Optional) 50_Tutor_Viewer.py (render lessons transcript/plots)

Paths & Files (read-only; align with Phase 2)
- Backtests: runs/<backtest_id>/{metrics.json, trades.csv, equity.png, config.yaml, logs/run.log}
  - Legacy equity images: runs/equity_{SYMBOL}_{STRAT}.png (display if present)
- Live: runs/live/sessions/<id>/{orders.csv, trades.csv, positions.csv, account.csv, session.md, plots/*.png, logs/run.log, state.json}
  - runs/live/latest_session (symlink or pointer file)
- Logs: logos/logs/live.log and logos/logs/app.log
- Tutor: runs/lessons/<lesson>/<timestamp>/{transcript.md|.txt, glossary.json, plots/*.png}

Performance & Quality
- Backtests page loads under 500ms for typical runs (<50k rows).
- Live Monitor avoids full rereads; cache by mtime and use small deltas.
- Handle partial file writes without crashing; show retry/empty-state.
- Accessibility: responsive layout, keyboard navigation, alt text, consistent colors.
- Security: never display secrets; redact any values with KEY/SECRET/TOKEN.

Testing
- tests/ui/test_data_access.py: validate loaders on fixtures in tests/fixtures/runs/…
- tests/ui/test_pages_import.py: import all pages and assert layout functions render without raising using fixtures/mocks.

Documentation
- docs/DASHBOARD.md: how to run, screenshots per page, file/metrics expectations and empty-state behavior.
- Update README.md and docs/MANUAL.html with “Phase 3 Dashboard” section and a short gif/screenshot.

Definition of Done (Phase 3)
- streamlit run logos/ui/streamlit/app.py launches without errors.
- Overview shows KPIs, recent backtests, and (if present) latest live session with PnL and log tail.
- Backtests page: run picker, metrics cards, equity with drawdown, trades table with filters/download, compare mode with overlay + metric deltas.
- Live Monitor: with a dummy/recorded session fixture, displays account snapshot, positions, trades, and live.log tail; autorefresh updates PnL chart and log tail.
- Strategy Lab lists strategies from logos/strategies and renders docstrings/param schemas and example CLIs.
- Settings shows redacted env/config and allows changing UI refresh interval and theme.
- Missing paths or empty runs produce clear empty-state cards—no stack traces.
- Tests pass: pytest -q (UI tests + existing suite).
- Docs updated: docs/DASHBOARD.md plus README & MANUAL references.
