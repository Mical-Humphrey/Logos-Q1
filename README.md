> ‚ÄúLearn like a student. Trade like a professional.‚Äù

## üî∑ Overview
**Logos-Q1** is a **quantitative trading research and execution system** designed for two parallel purposes:

1. **Education** ‚Äî a readable, well-documented codebase that teaches the core mathematics and logic behind algorithmic trading.
2. **Execution** ‚Äî a fully modular, pluggable framework that can connect to live markets and trade autonomously as a **solo quant developer** system.

Every line of code in Logos-Q1 is structured to be *understood, extended, and trusted* ‚Äî making it both a learning laboratory and a professional tool for real-world trading.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features
| Layer | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **CLI / GUI Interface** | Command-line interface for research; GUI planned for execution and dashboards. |
| **Data Loader** | Pulls equities, crypto, and FX data via Yahoo Finance or live exchange APIs. |
| **Strategy Engine** | Modular strategies (Mean Reversion, Momentum, Pairs Trading) ‚Äî all plug-and-play. |
| **Backtesting** | Multi-asset backtesting with equity, crypto, and FX cost models. |
| **Execution Simulator** | Models fills, slippage, commissions, and fees with configurable parameters. |
| **Metrics Suite** | Computes Sharpe, CAGR, Max Drawdown, Win Rate, Exposure, and custom ratios. |
| **Educational Math Docs** | Detailed `MATH.html` explaining the quantitative principles behind every function. |
| **Finance Docs** | `FINANCE.md` translates concepts into practical market behavior and case studies. |

## üß† Philosophy
- **Transparency first.** Every function and line is annotated and explained.
- **Modularity.** Each layer can be replaced ‚Äî data, strategy, execution, GUI.
- **Education through engineering.** The app is built so that every component *teaches itself* to the reader.
- **Competitive edge.** Designed to be the foundation of a true quant-research and execution workstation.

## üìà Vision Roadmap
| Stage | Focus | Deliverable |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Educational Backtesting (Complete) | CLI backtester with strategy plugins |
| **Phase 2** | Live Execution | Add broker/exchange connectors (CCXT, Alpaca, Interactive Brokers) |
| **Phase 3** | Visual Dashboard | Streamlit-based GUI with live trades, metrics, and logs |
| **Phase 4** | Advanced Research Tools | Portfolio optimization, ML alpha generation, risk modeling |
| **Phase 5** | Deployment | Run as local desktop app or EC2 instance with cloud sync |

## üß© Example Usage
```bash
# Mean reversion on equities
python3 -m src.cli backtest --asset-class equity --symbol MSFT \
  --strategy mean_reversion --start 2023-01-01 --end 2025-01-01 \
  --params "lookback=20,z_entry=2.0"

# Momentum on crypto
python3 -m src.cli backtest --asset-class crypto --symbol BTC-USD \
  --strategy momentum --start 2023-01-01 --end 2025-01-01 \
  --interval 1h --params "fast=20,slow=50"


Educational Mode
    Use MATH.html to learn each formula.
    Use FINANCE.md to understand market context.
    Use MANUAL.md for CLI and future GUI workflows.
    Each subsystem (data, strategy, execution) can be studied independently or extended as a course module.

üèóÔ∏è Built With
    Python 3.12+
    pandas, numpy, matplotlib
    yfinance
    (Future: Streamlit / CCXT / SQLite / FastAPI)

üïäÔ∏è MIT License ‚Äî Logos-Q1 is open for study, extension, and responsible live trading use.
